      <description>Workshop based on my book in progress.
Helping junior developers solve home assignments better: Work like professionals, improve their odds, and receive higher offers.
Workshop for Junior Developers Home assignments are here to stay as they offer less biased views and are more focused on the quality of your work.
Unfortunately, if you’re a Junior Developer, the quality of work is usually what stands out. Your projects won’t look like what a professional reviewer is used to: They may be messy, half-working, or lacking documentation and instructions.</description>

      <description>My partners and I cofounded Meekan, a calendar scheduling platform, raised funding, and went the standard way - develop iOS, Android and Outlook apps for it.
A year later we had 3 apps, lots of code, not much money and and very few users.
As one last shot, we tried meeting our users where they were - in an up-and-coming work tool called Slack. Only problem - The only integration we could write there was a chatbot.</description>
